# Opal is a ruby to javascript compiler, with a runtime for running
# in any javascript environment.
#
# Opal::Parser is the core class used for parsing ruby and generating
# javascript from its syntax tree. Opal::Processor is the main system used
# for compiling larger programs. Opal::Processor uses sprockets to maintain
# an environment of load paths, which can be used to require other ruby or
# javascript sources.
