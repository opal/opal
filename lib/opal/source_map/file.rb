  # Line 1: The entire file is a single JSON object
  # Line 2: File version (always the first entry in the object) and must be a
  #         positive integer.
  # Line 3: An optional name of the generated code that this source map is
  #         associated with.
  # Line 4: An optional source root, useful for relocating source files on a server
  #         or removing repeated values in the “sources” entry. This value is prepended to
  #         the individual entries in the “source” field.
  # Line 5: A list of original sources used by the “mappings” entry.
  # Line 6: An optional list of source content, useful when the “source” can’t be
  #         hosted. The contents are listed in the same order as the sources in line 5.
  #         “null” may be used if some original sources should be retrieved by name.
  # Line 7: A list of symbol names used by the “mappings” entry.
  # Line 8: A string with the encoded mapping data.

  # The fields in each segment are:

  #    the segment represents. If this is the first field of the first segment, or
  #    the first segment following a new generated line (“;”), then this field
  #    holds the whole base 64 VLQ. Otherwise, this field contains a base 64 VLQ
  #    that is relative to the previous occurrence of this field. Note that this
  #    is different than the fields below because the previous value is reset
  #    after every generated line.
  #
  # 2. If present, an zero-based index into the “sources” list. This field is
  #    a base 64 VLQ relative to the previous occurrence of this field, unless
  #    this is the first occurrence of this field, in which case the whole value
  #    is represented.
  #
  # 3. If present, the zero-based starting line in the original source
  #    represented. This field is a base 64 VLQ relative to the previous
  #    occurrence of this field, unless this is the first occurrence of this
  #    field, in which case the whole value is represented. Always present if
  #    there is a source field.
  #
  # 4. If present, the zero-based starting column of the line in the source
  #    represented. This field is a base 64 VLQ relative to the previous
  #    occurrence of this field, unless this is the first occurrence of this
  #    field, in which case the whole value is represented. Always present if
  #    there is a source field.
  #
  # 5. If present, the zero-based index into the “names” list associated with
  #    this segment. This field is a base 64 VLQ relative to the previous
  #    occurrence of this field, unless this is the first occurrence of this
  #    field, in which case the whole value is represented.
