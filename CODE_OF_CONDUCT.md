# Contributor Code of Conduct

1. We are all adults. Capable of having adult discussions.

2. We accept everyones contributions, we don’t care if you’re liberal or conservative, black or white, straight or gay, or anything else!  in fact, we won’t bring it up, or ask. We simply don’t give a shit.

3. Nothing else fucking matters!

This *not* Code of Conduct is adapted from the [NCoC - Not Code Of Conduct](http://nocodeofconduct.com/).
