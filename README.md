# Opal

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/opal/opal.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/opal/opal)

Opal is a ruby to javascript source-to-source compiler. It also has an 
implementation of the ruby corelib.

Opal is [hosted on github](http://github.com/opal/opal), and there
is a Freenode IRC channel at [#opal](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=opal). There is also a [google group for opal](http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opalrb).

## Usage

See the website, [http://opalrb.org](http://opalrb.org).

## Running tests

First, install dependencies:

    $ bundle install

Tests can be run with phantomjs using:

    $ rake

Or with v8 shell using:

    $ rake v8

Alternatively, you can just load up a rack instance using `rackup`, and
visit `http://localhost:9292/` in any web browser.

## Code Overview

### lib

The `lib` directory holds the opal parser/compiler used to compile ruby
into javascript. It is also built ready for the browser into `opal-parser.js`
to allow compilation in any javascript environment.

### opal

This directory holds the opal runtime and corelib implemented in ruby and
javascript. These are built using `rake`, as above.

### spec

* **core** contains rubyspecs that apply to opal.
* **language** applicable specs from rubyspec for testing language semantics
* **grammar** specs for opal lib (parser, lexer, grammar etc)
