Opal is a ruby to javascript source-to-source compiler. It also has an
implementation of the ruby corelib.

Opal is [hosted on github](http://github.com/opal/opal). There
is a Freenode IRC channel at [#opal](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=opal).

## Usage

See the website, [http://opalrb.org](http://opalrb.org).

### Compiling ruby code

`Opal.compile` is a simple interface to just compile a string of ruby into a
string of javascript code.

```ruby
Opal.compile("puts 'wow'")  # => "(function() { ... self.$puts("wow"); ... })()"
```

Running this by itself is not enough, you need the opal runtime/corelib.

### Building the corelib

`Opal::Builder` can be used to build the runtime/corelib into a string.

```ruby
Opal::Builder.build('opal') #=> "(function() { ... })()"
```

### Running compiled code

You can write the above two strings to file, and run as:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="opal.js"></script>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </head>
</html>
```

Just open a browser to this page and view the console.

## Running tests

First, install dependencies:

    $ bundle install

RubySpec related repos must be cloned as a gitsubmodules:

    $ git submodule update --init

The test suite can be run using (requires [phantomjs][]):

    $ rake

This will command will run all RSpec and MSpec examples in sequence.

#### Automated runs

A `Guardfile` with decent mappings between specs and lib/corelib/stdlib files is in place.
Run `bundle exec guard -i` to have it started.


### MSpec

[MSpec][] tests can be run with:

    $ rake mspec

Alternatively, you can just load up a rack instance using `rackup`, and
visit `http://localhost:9292/` in any web browser.


### Rspec

[RSpec][] tests can be run with

    $ rake rspec


## Code Overview

What code is supposed to run where?

* `lib/` code runs inside your ruby env. It compiles ruby to javascript.
* `opal/` is the runtime/corelib for our implementation (runs in browser)
* `stdlib/` is our implementation of ruby stdlib. It is optional (for browser).

### lib

The `lib` directory holds the opal parser/compiler used to compile ruby
into javascript. It is also built ready for the browser into `opal-parser.js`
to allow compilation in any javascript environment.

### corelib

This directory holds the opal runtime and corelib implemented in ruby and
javascript.

### stdlib

Holds the stdlib that opal currently supports. This includes `Observable`,
`StringScanner`, `Date`, etc.

## Browser support

* Internet Explorer 6+
* Firefox (Current - 1) or Current
* Chrome (Current - 1) or Current
* Safari 5.1+
* Opera 12.1x or (Current - 1) or Current

Any problems encountered using the browsers listed above should be reported as a bug.

(Current - 1) or Current denotes that we support the current stable version of
the browser and the version that preceded it. For example, if the current
version of a browser is 24.x, we support the 24.x and 23.x versions.

12.1x or (Current - 1) or Current denotes that we support Opera 12.1x as well
as the last 2 versions of Opera. For example, if the current Opera version is 20.x,
then we support Opera 12.1x, 19.x and 20.x but not Opera 15.x through 18.x.

Cross-browser testing is sponsored by [BrowserStack](http://browserstack.com).
