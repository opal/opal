Opal is a Ruby to JavaScript source-to-source compiler. It also has an
implementation of the Ruby corelib.

Opal is [hosted on GitHub](http://github.com/opal/opal). Chat is available on *Gitter* at [opal/opal](https://gitter.im/opal/opal) (also available as IRC at `irc.gitter.im`) and the Freenode IRC channel at [#opal](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=opal).

## Usage

See the website for more detailed instructions and guides for Rails, jQuery, Sinatra, rack, CDN, etc. [http://opalrb.org](http://opalrb.org).

### Compiling Ruby code with the CLI (Command Line Interface)

Contents of `app.rb`:

```ruby
puts 'Hello world!'
```

Then from the terminal

```bash
$ opal --compile app.rb > app.js # The Opal runtime is included by default
                                 # but can be skipped with the --no-opal flag
```

The resulting JavaScript file can be used normally from an HTML page:

```html
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

Be sure to set the page encoding to `UTF-8` inside your `<head>` tag as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <script src="app.js"></script>
    …
  </head>
  <body>
    …
  </body>
</html>
```

Just open this page in a browser and check the JavaScript console.


### Compiling Ruby code from Ruby

`Opal.compile` is a simple interface to just compile a string of Ruby into a
string of JavaScript code.

```ruby
Opal.compile("puts 'wow'")  # => "(function() { ... self.$puts("wow"); ... })()"
```

Running this by itself is not enough; you need the opal runtime/corelib.

#### Using Opal::Builder

`Opal::Builder` can be used to build the runtime/corelib into a string.

```ruby
Opal::Builder.build('opal') #=> "(function() { ... })()"
```

or to build an entire app including dependencies declared with `require`:

```ruby
builder = Opal::Builder.new
builder.build_str('require "opal"; puts "wow"', '(inline)')
File.write 'app.js', builder.to_s
```


### Compiling Ruby code from HTML (or using it as you would with inline JavaScript)

`opal-parser` allows you to *eval* Ruby code directly from your HTML (and from Opal) files without needing any other building process.

So you can create a file like the one below, and start writing ruby for
your web applications.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <script src="http://cdn.opalrb.org/opal/current/opal.js"></script>
    <script src="http://cdn.opalrb.org/opal/current/opal-parser.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">Opal.load('opal-parser')</script>

    <script type="text/ruby">
      puts "hi"
    </script>

  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

Just open this page and check the JavaScript console.

**NOTE**: Although this is possible, this is not really recommended for
production and should only be used as a quick way to get your hands
on opal.

## Running tests

The Ruby Spec Suite related repos must be cloned as git submodules:

    $ git submodule update --init

Then, install dependencies:

    $ bundle install
    $ npm install -g jshint

The test suite can be run using:

    $ bundle exec rake

This will command will run all RSpec and MSpec examples in sequence.

#### Automated runs

A `Guardfile` with decent mappings between specs and lib/corelib/stdlib files is in place.
Run `bundle exec guard -i` to start `guard`.


### MSpec

[MSpec][] tests can be run with:

    $ rake mspec

Alternatively, you can just load up a rack instance using `rackup`, and
visit `http://localhost:9292/` in any web browser.


### RSpec

[RSpec][] tests can be run with:

    $ rake rspec


## Code Overview

What code is supposed to run where?

* `lib/` code runs inside your Ruby env. It compiles Ruby to JavaScript.
* `opal/` is the runtime+corelib for our implementation (runs in browser).
* `stdlib/` is our implementation of Ruby's stdlib. It is optional (runs in browser).

### lib/

The `lib` directory holds the **Opal parser/compiler** used to compile Ruby
into JavaScript. It is also built ready for the browser into `opal-parser.js`
to allow compilation in any JavaScript environment.

### opal/

This directory holds the **Opal runtime and corelib** implemented in Ruby and
JavaScript.

### stdlib/

Holds the **stdlib currently supported by Opal**. This includes `Observable`,
`StringScanner`, `Date`, etc.

## Browser support

* Internet Explorer 9+
* Firefox (Current - 1) or Current
* Chrome (Current - 1) or Current
* Safari (Current - 1) or Current
* Opera (Current - 1) or Current

Any problems encountered using the browsers listed above should be reported as bugs.

(Current - 1) or Current denotes that we support the current stable version of
the browser and the version that preceded it. For example, if the current
version of a browser is 24.x, we support the 24.x and 23.x versions.

12.1x or (Current - 1) or Current denotes that we support Opera 12.1x as well
as the last 2 versions of Opera. For example, if the current Opera version is 20.x,
then we support Opera 12.1x, 19.x and 20.x but not Opera 15.x through 18.x.

Cross-browser testing is sponsored by [SauceLabs](http://saucelabs.com).
