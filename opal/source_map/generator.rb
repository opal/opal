  module Generator

    # An object (responding to <<) that will be written to whenever
    # {add_generated} is called.
    #
    # @example
    #
    #   File.open("/var/www/a.js.min"){ |f|
    #     map = SourceMap.new(:generated_output => f)
    #     map.add_generated('function(a,b,c){minified=1}\n', :source => 'a.js')
    #     map.save('/var/www/a.js.map')
    #   }

    attr_accessor :generated_output

    # Add the mapping for generated code to this source map.
    #
    # The first parameter is the generated text that you're going to add to the output, if
    # it contains multiple lines of code then it will be added to the source map as
    # several mappings.
    #
    # If present, the second parameter represents the original source of the generated
    # fragment, and may contain:
    #
    # :source => String,           # The filename of the source fille that contains this fragment.
    # :source_line => Integer,     # The line in that file that contains this fragment
    # :source_col => Integer,      # The column in that line at which this fragment starts
    # :name => String              # The original name for this variable.
    # :exact_position => Bool      # Whether all lines in the generated fragment came from
    #                                the same position in the source.
    #
    # The :source key is required to set :source_line, :source_col or :name.
    #
    # If unset :source_line and :source_col default to 1,0 for the first line of the
    # generated fragment.
    #
    # Normally :source_line is incremented and :source_col reset at every line break in
    # the generated code (because we assume that you're copying a verbatim fragment from
    # the source into the generated code). If that is not the case, you can set
    # :exact_position => true, and then all lines in the generated output will be given
    # the same :source_line and :source_col.
    #
    # The :name property is used if the fragment you are adding contains only a name that
    # you have renamed in the source transformation.
    #
    # If you'd like to ensure that the source map stays in sync with the generated
    # source, consider calling {source_map.generated_output = StringIO.new} and then
    # accessing your generated javascript with {source_map.generated_output.string},
    # otherwise be careful to always write to both.
    #
    # NOTE: By long-standing convention, the first line of a file is numbered 1, not 0.
    #
    # NOTE: when generating a source map, you should either use this method always, or use
    # the {#add_mapping} method always.

    # Add a mapping to the list for this object.
    #
    # A mapping identifies a fragment of code that has been moved around during
    # transformation from the source file to the generated file. The fragment should
    # be contiguous and not contain any line breaks.
    #
    # Mappings are Hashes with a valid subset of the following 6 keys:
    #
    # :generated_line => Integer,  # The line in the generated file that contains this fragment.
    # :generated_col  => Integer,  # The column in the generated_line that this mapping starts on
    # :source => String,           # The filename of the source fille that contains this fragment.
    # :source_line => Integer,     # The line in that file that contains this fragment.
    # :source_col => Integer,      # The column in that line at which this fragment starts.
    # :name => String              # The original name for this variable (if applicable).
    #
    #
    # The only 3 valid subsets of keys are:
    #   [:generated_line, :generated_col] To indicate that this is a fragment in the
    #   output file that you don't have the source for.
    #
    #   [:generated_line, :generated_col, :source, :source_line, :source_col] To indicate
    #   that this is a fragment in the output file that you do have the source for.
    #
    #   [:generated_line, :generated_col, :source, :source_line, :source_col, :name] To
    #   indicate that this is a particular identifier at a particular location in the original.
    #
    # Any other combination of keys would produce an invalid source map.
    #
    # NOTE: By long-standing convention, the first line of a file is numbered 1, not 0.
