# This is an utility to automatically remove a group of filters provided
# to its standard input.
#
# This utility is to assist with removing a large group of filters spread
# around multiple files that is being output by a command:
#
# rake mspec_ruby_nodejs RUBYSPECS=true INVERT_RUNNING_MODE=true
#
# It expects an input of format:
#  1) "Set#filter! returns an Enumerator when passed no block"
#  2) "Set#filter! yields every element of self"
#  3) "Set#filter! keeps every element from self for which the passed block returns true"
#  4) "Set#filter! returns self when self was modified"
#  5) "Set#filter! returns nil when self was not modified"

filters = $stdin.read.split("\n").map do |i|
  # This special example should be rather moved to unsupported for now...
  next if i =~ /formats the local time following the pattern/

  i.scan(/\d+\) (".*")/).first.first
end.compact
filters = Regexp.union(*filters)

remove_filters = -> path {
  file = File.read(path).split("\n")

  remove, good = file.partition { |i| i =~ filters }

  if remove.length > 0
    puts "Removing #{remove.length} filters from #{path}"

    File.write(path, good.join("\n")+"\n")
  end
}

Dir['spec/filters/**/*.rb'].each do |path|
  remove_filters[path]
end
