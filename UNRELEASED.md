### Added

- Basic support for `uplevel:` keyword argument in `Kernel#warn` (#2006)

- Use magic-comments to declare helpers required by the file (#2038)
- `Opal.$$` is now a shortcut for `Opal.const_get_relative` (#2038)
- `Opal.$$$` is now a shortcut for `Opal.const_get_qualified` (#2038)
- Added support for `globalThis` as the generic global object accessor (#2047)
- `Opal::Compiler#magic_comments` that allows to access magic-comments format and converts it to a hash
- Use magic-comments to declare helpers required by the file
